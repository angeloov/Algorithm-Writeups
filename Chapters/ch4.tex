\section{Tips and tricks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sometimes a technique could be suggested in the text of the problem, like ``find the minimal possible maximum value in $a$'' could make you think that binary search has to be used. While sometimes a simple greedy solution can be found.
\end{itemize}

\section{Properties of XOR}
\begin{flushleft}
$a \oplus a = 0$\\
$a \oplus 0 = a$\\
$a \oplus 1 = \sim a$, where $\sim$ is bit complement.\\
$a \oplus \sim a = 1$\\
$a \oplus b = b \oplus a$ (commutativity)\\
$a \oplus (b \oplus c) = (a \oplus b) \oplus c$ (associativity)\\
$a \oplus a \oplus a = a$\\
If $a \oplus b = c$, then $c \oplus b = a$ and $c \oplus a = b$.
